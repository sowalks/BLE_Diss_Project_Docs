Can i research what is the best parameters??? For best detection and prevention.

What if a phone does not listen and sends anyway? Or is in the weird range?  Ensure Blocked

- Parameters I need to evaluate and research are the time period to wait before transmitting location to check i this has been inhibited.
- How long for a phone to send all detected as inhibited,

- When deploying a BLE positioning system, there are
many parameters to consider, including: 
- fingerprint construction algorithm
- beacon rate
- transmit power
- antenna orientation
- beacon mobility
- beacon geometry
- beacon density

WE CAN USE THESE FOR INHIBITOR TAG SOME OF AT LEAST
