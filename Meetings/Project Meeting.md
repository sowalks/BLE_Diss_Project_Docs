Sounds change 

My project will develop a prototype of a demonstration n system - clear own system

data collection tool to explore more algorithms

inhibitor tags needed??


can phones be inhibitor tags!!

idea we might not be personal phone not to be stalked

Put inhibitor on school bag for child or car etc - not personal phone


multiple inhibitor tags unlike phones


verification for false alarms - 

accidental interference

range and time bubble to be effective not overkill disrupting others



Parameterisation - in reality 

phones that always locate tags â€“ have estimate where they are - tag reports where phone is


more levels - phone itself can have a big error

how good phone position estimate a=can be 

phone can tell us its error

thought experiments

find out how messy first!
before other stuff


realistic trialling in indoor spaces
tags buried

is a mess
does this concept work?? we're creating a prototype to find out if this could work

when does it rk, how to break, specific scenarios

Success Criteria

describe more what should actually work

describe a server that should receive from app reports about beacons that have been observed with RSSI and phone location

server then provides to user a user interface to first provide a tracking system


GOAL MAIN IS TO PROVIDE A TRACKING SYSTEM


GOAL IS TO BUILD AN AIRTAG LIKE TRACKING SYSTEM

AVOID PASSIVE VOICE

find some web server in resources

where will be 

can i HAVE ubuntu linux virtual machine


get web server

CGI scripts to get root access
SCRF 

CGI script for everyb HTTP request so may be slow

wsgi

fsgi

interfaces??



## Contingency Plan

Simplest thing run on my laptop - all data is logged on devices wiht time stamp

Then play back files on laptop as if file was working with timestamps

Then add in range

Server is moddellled on laptops interleaved by timestamps as i f data was coming into server at certain times


having a server analogy

simulation

Data gathered as offline recordings.

Program simulate  


build project

enough to write about

prototype service with user interface

Tick more boxes in evaluation and assessment

last 2 weeks polish entire thing


work plan 

MAKE A GANTT CHART

have phones know what an inhibitor is and not send tags on!! - get inhibitor id list from server.


Resources running a server - cloud providers google amazon azure - freebie servers

Azure tha

information for current student - free software from microsoft - 200hours of free virtual machine time

You can use free google colab access to run a web app?

introduction chapterv- week 8-10 at absolute latest

week 20 is not 

GitHub  - upload the disseration and code and Obsidian

SET UP NOW
