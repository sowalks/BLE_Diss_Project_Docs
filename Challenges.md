I did not anticipate multiple versions of android for the phones. Having different models and android versions majorly affected creating a logging system for my app.
Due to the app being modified, I did not predict dealing with different versions of android due to the existing app and assumed logging would be a very quick task. The main part of the task was simple, however, no permissions are required for android 13 to write to external storage the 'Download' folder, however  a legacy solution and extra WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is required to make the same code work for android 10. In addition to this, when testing my code this poses issues, if I delete or modify the logs,which I should to test, the file is no longer owned by the app, so cannot create a new log with the same name, and will crash every time I modify my app as the system does not recognise it as the same app so no longer owns the logging file. I temporarily changed the logging file name every time I tested my code. However I aim to use local logging to avoid this, then I can introduce an export button to export the logs to external storage where I can access them as a user.
