[[Deadlines]]


Hopefully that's all useful - I think a good input for our catch up discussion next week will be some of your first thoughts on what you would like the project to cover and it's main implementation activity with the mark scheme in mind (core components plus some extensions) and a rough description of how the experiments you will need might be conducted.

**Bluetooth tracking privacy bubble**

Bluetooth-based tracking tags have been available for a decade for finding lost items. They were pioneered by companies like Tile and popularised by Apple's AirTag, which has the global user base of Apple products listening for AirTags in their vicinity and reporting ones they find back to a central server. Unfortunately this new capability has been exploited for criminal purposes such as stalking. This project will explore registering tags into two modes – normal tracking tags and inhibitor tags. When in range of an inhibitor tag, a device will not report any tracking tags it detects within a given interval of time and space. This will let people create a "protection bubble" around themselves and their property. You will use open-source bluetooth tracking tags to demonstrate and develop the concept; you'll propose and test potential implementations, investigate mechanisms such as encryption, and conduct real-world trials.



Don't forget, feel free to ask any questions along the way before we catch up again next week

ALSO FULL Proposal

Basically dissertation has to demonstrate:
- I have a range of CS skills, planning skills and design /quality,
- show an understanding of context of project,  [[Notes on Ramsey Papers]]
- justify suitable tools, i.e. programming langs and data structures, show I can learn new ones. 
- Plan and organise presentation of evidence – end result behaves as intended.

i.e. tools and algorithms include BLE?

Do I need ethics committee [[Ethics committee]]  - look into it
## Questions to ask Ramsey:
-  open beacon? They do not cycle ids. Also resource requirements

-  Does the marks scheme mean by strucutred design and evaluation approach
-  Should i include more complex feature modelling like Rayleigh [[Notes on Ramsey Papers#Covid Talk]]etc (LOOK IT UP) than just the median for my project, or could it be an extension?
