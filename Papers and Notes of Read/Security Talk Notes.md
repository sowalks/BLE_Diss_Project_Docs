# Abuse-Resistant Location Tracking

In this work we show how to achieve an improved trade-off between user privacy and stalker detection
within the constraints of existing tracking protocols. We implement our new protocol using families of
list-decodable error-correcting codes, and give efficient algorithms for stalker detection under realistic
conditions.

OOOO

[[Motivation]] These devices have been used in hundreds of criminal incidents, including
serious cases that culminated in physical assault and murder [8, 49, 23,

air tag attack by reflashing sending blobs - probably signed but attacked

PHONE HAS TO VERIFY THIS FROM ACTUAL TAG - STOP HARDWARE ATTACKS NON TRIVIAL


phone hardware tags w/o correct protocol.
Neeed to not respond to verified tags


need to look up symmetric key publically etc

just assume existance of trustworthy pki- lol!!!

other servers natural pki 

off load payload to pki 
remove everything suspicious


airtag do not have data connection of their own

test anonymously that you are part of a set


assassins is of interest!!
