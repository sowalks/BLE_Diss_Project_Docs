'single target' - me

Attempts to track/place uninhibited trackers on me 

If you can do this then successfully tag me 3+ hrs later.

Will make no attempt to block and solely rely on inhibitor bubble.

Issues w previous assassins study.

With a single target we should have more success.

less likely to search through bags?


gather data at set points

Minigame walking/cycling along route.

Will be stopped at certain 'safe' points where i will stop and be open to being tags puit on me openly. I will ha


This should work as my phone will be the one sending stuff back to the server. So it doesnt matter the others being far?

Alternatively we could have an experiment 
where a group near each pother in college use this to trakc items etc? bit boring
