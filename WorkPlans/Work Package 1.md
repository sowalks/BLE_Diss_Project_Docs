#### Set up existing scanner app, explore and test unchanged.

Add a logging function to create csv of what has been detected.

- Add all to list of BLE experiments in google drive

- do an experiment by walking for an hour around the lab and log how many devices are found and what strengths in a lecture - potential to have more airtags here than a regular busy area.
- Repeat walking down kings parade
- Collect RSSIs detected, also.
- Reoccuring tags?

#### Set up and learn to use MySQL with Flask. 

- Create a small server w flask that can receive basic results from an app 
- Follow a short tutorial to make a sample


#### Do some basic tests and evaluation of received tracking tags with a standard app. 

Plan 3 experiments using all 6 tags and the distances. detection in diff environments and rssi

- add all to BLE google drive docs

find settings etc

- evaluate safe distance accuracy outside 
- evaluate distance accuracy inside
- does this change with a person standing in between.
- can this be done in the street., check ethics

#### Write up of completed experiments and limitations that could affect this project.

- Draw conclusions from experiment results.
- Summarise them all in 2 pages.
#### Write up the understanding of modifications and requirements of the app.

- Keep making notes of what the chosen app doesn't have etc
- May only be a short list/etc
- This will include the flask stuff
