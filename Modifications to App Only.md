declare 'ownership' of a device/register it. 
I cannot do the connecting thing + is irrelevant - so will simply open register, if deice nearby signalling unknowned ( by hcecking server - add that to the list w your own) - issues wiht this but not the focus


Only display your own device. - list distance to ur device if you can register it.

or distance from a certain position from the phone it has been detected by
- this is implemanted by when the app is open, and you send a request location (either auto or by tapping button) - server sends back last seen time and location range - i.e. 15m from this coordinate

- Change mode button - change owned device (choose by user's name (actually ids)) - and register w server

- send other detected/ranged - aggregated  as this is a lot -  in background detections (make every 15min?) to  server.
- i.e. ids, avg distance in the last min to server + GPS location
-  find the same 


- fix loggin and backgroudn scanning
