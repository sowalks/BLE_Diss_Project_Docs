### Starting point

A statement of the starting point must be present to ensure that all candidates are judged on the same basis. It should record any significant bodies of code or other material that will form a basis for your project and which exist at project proposal time. Provided a proper declaration is made here, it is in order to build your final project on work you started perhaps even a year earlier, or to create parts of your programs by modifying existing ones written by somebody else. Clearly the larger the input to your project from such sources the more precise and detailed you will have to be in reporting just what baseline you will be starting from. The Examiners will want this section to be such that they can judge all candidates on the basis of that part of work done between project proposal time and the time when dissertations are submitted. The starting point should describe the state of existing software at the point you write your proposal (so work that you may have performed over the summer vacation is counted as preparatory work). 

The open-source app I am adapting is found here which icludes BLE tracking libraries.
This will be completed in Java* which I have experience with from the OOP course. I will also use Python Flask to build the webserver, which I have used briefly before in the Group Project last year. I have used SQL in databases, but not MySQL specifically.  I have not previously used tools related to BLE tracking tags before.
