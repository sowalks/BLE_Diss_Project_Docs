When you have decomposed your entire project into sub-tasks you can try to identify which
of these sub-tasks are going to be hard and which easy, and hence estimate the relative
amounts of effort involved in each

## Ideas

Core deliverable could include using a simple median to  detect distance and noise for sampling rate + get rid of spurious highs - based on 3 channels
need tag to signal over 3 channels
- however an extension could be to use strong detection methods for distance to improve accuracy  i.e. rayleigh or other methods that have been used by the NHS etc in [[Notes on Ramsey Papers#Covid Talk]]
