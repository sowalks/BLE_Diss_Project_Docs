Preventative tool vs reactive after stalking has taken place for a period of time

Out of scope" doesn't quite sound right - perhaps "out of range" instead or making it clearer with something like "Benign tags will not be permanently co-located with inhibitor tags as they move through the environment and will eventually move away from them"

We should assume you will modify the app to provide datapackets of information according to your own particular preferred scheme (timestamp, phone position estimate, phone position estimate accuracy, BLE ID, BLE RSSI, .... etc)

As soon as the tags arrive I think we want to do a handful of quick and easy sanity check experiments to get a quick understanding of what we are working with - use a standard app, check it is detecting tags ok, get a feel for the range of the tags, how often they are squeaking, etc, start thinking about the experiment designs accordingly. Perhaps this is already the "Evidence of successful testing" part?

The tags are due to arrive later this week and I have 1 phone for you already and 2 more will be available in the coming days
