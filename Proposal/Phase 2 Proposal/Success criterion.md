### Success criterion

Similarly, a proposal must specify what it means for the project to be a success. It is unacceptable to say “I’ll just keep writing code in this general area and what I deliver is what you get”. It is advisable to choose a reasonably modest, but verifiable, success criterion which you are as certain as possible can be met; this means that your dissertation can claim your project not only satisfies the success criterion but potentially exceeds it. Projects that do not satisfy the success criterion are, as in real life, liable to be seen as failures to some extent.

- An app must be modified that can register BLE tags in two modes and communicate with the server.
- A server must be built that can locate tags, and mark those which are in range of inhibitor tags.
- I will investigate the time and distance ranges that will be appropriate for this bubble, based on experiments centred on the range we can be accurate in, and how far it needs to be to cover a person from stalking.
- The 'owner' devices of tags should be able to receive the location of their tags in the app if they are not in the inhibitor range.
