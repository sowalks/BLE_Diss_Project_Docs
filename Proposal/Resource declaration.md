The resources that this project requires are BLE tracking tags to test and create the inhibitor and tracking system.
Android phones are required to detect the tags.
Both of these will be provided by Dr Ramsey Faragher. 
In the case they are not provided, I will be able to simulate BLE beacons on my laptop and use my personal phone.
I will use my personal laptop to build this, with another personal laptop as a contingency. I will backup all code to GitHub and use it's version control. I will write my dissertation in Obsidian note-taking software and Google Docs where appropriate. I will back up my Obsidian Vault to GitHub, and Google Docs on my Google Drive..
I accept full responsibility for this machine and I have made contingency plans to protect myself against hardware and/or software failure.
