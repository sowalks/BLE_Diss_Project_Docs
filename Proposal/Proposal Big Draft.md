### Format of the proposal

A project proposal is expected to be about 1000 words long. It consists of the following:

1. A standard [cover sheet](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/files/proposalform.pdf)
2. The body of the proposal (see below).

When emailing drafts of your proposal to Project Checkers, please make sure they contain all of the information required on the final cover sheet.

The body of the proposal should incorporate:

1. An introduction and description of the work to be undertaken.
2. A statement of the starting point.
3. Description of the substance and structure of the project: key concepts, major work items, their relations and relative importance, data structures and algorithms.
4. A criterion that can later be used to determine whether the project has been a success.
5. Plan of work, specifying a timetable and milestones.
6. Resource declaration.
