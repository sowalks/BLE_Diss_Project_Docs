### Format of the proposal

A project proposal is expected to be about 1000 words long. It consists of the following:

1. A standard [cover sheet](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/files/proposalform.pdf)
2. The body of the proposal (see below).

When emailing drafts of your proposal to Project Checkers, please make sure they contain all of the information required on the final cover sheet.

The body of the proposal should incorporate:

1. An introduction and description of the work to be undertaken.
2. A statement of the starting point.
3. Description of the substance and structure of the project: key concepts, major work items, their relations and relative importance, data structures and algorithms.
4. A criterion that can later be used to determine whether the project has been a success.
5. Plan of work, specifying a timetable and milestones.
6. Resource declaration.

### Introduction and description

This text will expand on the title quoted for your project by giving further explanation both of the background to the work you propose to do and of the objectives you expect to achieve. Quite often a project title will do little more than identify a broad area within which you will work: the accompanying description must elaborate on this, giving details of specific goals to be achieved and precise characterisations of the methods that will be used in the process. You should identify the main sub-tasks that make up your complete project and outline the algorithms or techniques to be adopted in completing them. A project description should give criteria that can be used at the end of the year to test whether you have achieved your goals, and should back this up by explaining what form of evidence to this effect you expect to be able to include in your dissertation.

### Starting point

A statement of the starting point must be present to ensure that all candidates are judged on the same basis. It should record any significant bodies of code or other material that will form a basis for your project and which exist at project proposal time. Provided a proper declaration is made here, it is in order to build your final project on work you started perhaps even a year earlier, or to create parts of your programs by modifying existing ones written by somebody else. Clearly the larger the input to your project from such sources the more precise and detailed you will have to be in reporting just what baseline you will be starting from. The Examiners will want this section to be such that they can judge all candidates on the basis of that part of work done between project proposal time and the time when dissertations are submitted. The starting point should describe the state of existing software at the point you write your proposal (so work that you may have performed over the summer vacation is counted as preparatory work).

### Success criterion

Similarly, a proposal must specify what it means for the project to be a success. It is unacceptable to say “I’ll just keep writing code in this general area and what I deliver is what you get”. It is advisable to choose a reasonably modest, but verifiable, success criterion which you are as certain as possible can be met; this means that your dissertation can claim your project not only satisfies the success criterion but potentially exceeds it. Projects that do not satisfy the success criterion are, as in real life, liable to be seen as failures to some extent.

### Work plan

You will need to describe how your project is split up into two- or three-week chunks of work and milestones, as explained in the [planning section](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part-ii/projects/project-proposal#planning).

### Resource declaration

You should list resources required, as described in the [resources section](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching/part-ii/projects/project-proposal#resources)
