Subject: Phase 1 - Walker: Bluetooth Tracking Privacy Bubble

**Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report**

Name:  Sophie Walker           

College:  St. Catharine's College         

CRSID: smw98     

Director of Studies:  John Fawcett

**Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.**

**1.** Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

I will create a tracking system for BLE tags with two modes, tracker and inhibitor. This either locates them or prevents tags within a time/distance bubble from being tracked. This tool can prevent stalking. I will adapt an open-source app and build a server. This server will store which mode tags are in and implement the inhibitor bubbles and tracking. I will compare inhibiting on a local device or through the server. Evaluating if inhibiting as specified and its usability. I will research current BLE systems for detection of tags, like expected effectiveness of detecting inhibitors and trackers together.


2. Please list names of potential project supervisors, indicating
any interactions you have had with them, for example: not
contacted, awaiting reply, in discussion, agreed to supervise.

Markus Kuhn and Ramsey Faragher â€“ agreed to supervise.

**3.** Is there any chance that your project will involve **any**
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

The resources that this project requires are BLE tracking tags to test and create the inhibitor and tracking system, and android phones to detect the tags.
I also require my own machine to build the project on.
